Hi, I am now an Associate Professor with Multimedi Institute of <font color=green>Tianjin University</font>. I received the B.E and Ph.D. degree from <font color=green>Shanghai Jiao Tong Univeristy</font> under the supervision of Prof. [Xiaokang Yang](http://english.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/english/detail/842_802.htm) and Prof. [Guangtao Zhai](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=E6zbSYgAAAAJ). I am also supervised by Prof. [Chang Wen Chen](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/UBMM/People/dr.chen.html) when visiting at [SUNY@Buffalo](https://sites.google.com/view/jingliusite/home) from 2014-2015. My research interest includes: image/video processing and cross-modal video content analysis. 

I have contributed to deep learning methods for solving artificial intelligence challenges in real-world applications, including image enhancement, anomaly detection, recommendation systems, and cross modal retrieval. My research has been published in top conferences and journals, including <font color=orange>TIP, TCSVT, TMM, DSP, CVPR, and IFTC</font> .Our group is supported by the [National Natural Science Foundation of China in 2023](https://www.nsfc.gov.cn/)、the [Tianjin Natural Science Foundation](https://kxjs.tj.gov.cn/), and the  [National Natural Science Foundation 2021](https://www.nsfc.gov.cn/) .
