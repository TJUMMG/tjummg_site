abstract: In recent years, an increasing online shopping demand has greatly promoted the innovation and development of the fashion industry. Visual fashion analysis has become a prospective research topic in computer vision and multimedia fields. Among these studies, fashion compatibility analysis is required in many real applications, such as fashion recommendation, matching, and retrieval. However, learning fashion compatibility is nontrivial, not only due to the uncertain and sparse dependencies among fashion items but also the latent and mutual associations among multiple factors such as color, texture, style, and functionality. To better predict fashion compatibility, in this paper, we proposed a tripartite graph regularized latent low-rank representation method, named TGRLLR, for fashion compatibility prediction. In TGRLLR, to learn more low-dimensional and effective representations, we considered the latent low-rank representation by decomposing the original feature matrix in both the column and row directions to tackle the problem of insufficient observations. On this basis, we simultaneously exploited different regularization strategies to encode the structured correlations among features, the high-order relationships among items, and the geometrical structures of outfits for more informative representations. Extensive experiments conducted on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared with state-of-the-art methods.
